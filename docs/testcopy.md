# Testing Activities

## Introduction
Testing activities are essential to ensure the quality and reliability of software applications. They help identify defects, verify functionality, and validate that the system meets user requirements.

## Types of Testing Activities
1. **Unit Testing**  
    Focuses on testing individual components or modules in isolation.

2. **Integration Testing**  
    Ensures that different modules or components work together as expected.

3. **System Testing**  
    Validates the complete and integrated system against the specified requirements.

4. **Acceptance Testing**  
    Determines whether the system meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.

5. **Regression Testing**  
    Verifies that new changes have not adversely affected existing functionality.
